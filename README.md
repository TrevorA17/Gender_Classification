# Gender Classification
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict gender based on various facial features such as forehead dimensions, nose and lip characteristics, and hair length. The dataset, containing over 5,000 records, was preprocessed and explored through statistical analysis and visualization techniques. We trained multiple classification models, including logistic regression and random forest, and evaluated their performance using bootstrapping and cross-validation. The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy and kappa scores, making it the best-performing model for this task. Finally, the model was deployed via a Plumber API, enabling real-time gender predictions through a simple web interface or API call.
